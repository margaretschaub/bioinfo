# Project Introduction 12/01/2023

The goal of this project is to explore differential expression pathways associated with various diseases, leveraging the wealth of open-source biological data available. My name is Maci Schaub, and I am currently pursuing a Masters in Biotechnology. I received my B.S. in Biological Sciences. My experience working with neurology clinical research data and passion for data analysis with Python has inspired me to pursue bioinformatics learning. 

I intend to produce content that can be published with Quarto, an open source technical publishing system. This will be documentation of my learning and progress with the intent to be shared with other potential learners.
