- Read basics on markdown files: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
- Downloaded jupyter lab and wrote introduction.md
- jupyter lab launched from command line with command: jupyter lab

## 12/15/2023
- Created remote repository bioinfo: https://github.com/margaretschaub/bioinfo
- Linked jupyter lab to github remote repository using personal access token
- Created LICENSE, README.md. .gitignore files
- Fetched and merged remote repository with local jupyter lab Bioinformatics Open Source Project directory - worked around “fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories” error due to creating a new repository, adding a few commits to it, and then trying to pull from a remote repository that already has some commits of its own. Git throws the error since it has no idea how the two projects are related. The error is resolved with allow-unrelated-histories after a git pull or git merge command.
