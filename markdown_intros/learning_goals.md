# Learning Goals

1. Become more familiar with git concepts of cloning, branching, fetching, merging, pulling. My git knowledge thus far has been mainly adding to local repository and pushing to remote repository. I would like to learn about the collaborative potentials of git in order to work with others, ie. how to create different branches and be able to use git language to collaborate efficiently with others 
1. Markdown utilization
1. Document and describe process of working through a project start to finish
1. Investigate methods commonly used in bioinformatics anlaysis using open source data from research papers
1. Choose an investigative topic related to differential expression pathways associated with various diseases
1. Explore and identify appropriate open source data sets
1. Use pandas to download and manage expression data
1. Preprocess and Normalize Data: pandas for data manipulation
1. What is purpose of threshold selection, intersection Analysis
1. DEG Analysis using DESeq2-python
1. Using Python's scipy or statsmodels for statistical analyses
1. Visualization using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn, explore options for visualization techniques
1. Functional enrichment analysis (GO and KEGG Analysis) with Python libraries like gprofiler or clusterProfiler
1. Explore potential of network analysis techniques for interactions between genes or proteins
1. Adjust learning goals and project scope becomes more apparent
1. Investigate the potential API integration as API utlization is something I would like to learn
1. Using Quarto as an open source technical publishing system for creating a website to showcase project, establish scientific writing skills to communicate findings and processes
1. Demonstrate skills in database design: manage data in such a way that it allows easy access to the existing information and to submit new entries as they are produced
1. Demonstrate understanding of probability and statistics concepts
1. Honing and demonstrating python programming skills
