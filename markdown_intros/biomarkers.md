# Biomarkers

**Overview**
Biomarkers to potentially explore for leukemia = CD123, CD33, CD138, CD52, CD34, CD22, NPM1 protein, FLT3 protein 
& Hub genes: ABCA6, CCDC88A, PMEPA1, EBF1, FILIP1L, and TEAD2

Biomarkers to potentially explore for lymphoma = CD20, CD30, BCL2, MYC gene, CD79b protein

## Leukemia

CD123, CD33, CD138, CD52, CD34

The most clinically important point is that mutation of the FLT3 gene is the most frequent genetic alteration and a poor prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. There are two major types of FLT3 mutations: internal tandem duplication mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (FLT3‐ITD) and point mutations or deletion in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3‐TKD). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7004512/

    What is the protein result of a mutation in FLT3?? 
    
Taking a preliminary look into FLT3 mutations on TCGA with criteria "Disease Type IS acute lymphoblastic leukemia AND Primary Site IS hematopoietic and reticuloendothelial systems" the mutation type columnn is not showing any internal tandem duplications like the above research article mentioins are common in nthe juxtamembrane domain. I am not sure if TCGA has the capability to show duplication mutations. According to this article, Genomon ITDetector: a tool for somatic internal tandem duplication detection from cancer genome sequencing data, these type of mutations can be hard to detect. The authors created a tool to detect not only common ITDs involving FLT3, but also a number of ITDs affecting other putative driver genes in acute myeloid leukemia exome sequencing data.

Nucleophosmin, also known as nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 or numatrin, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NPM1 gene

six hub genes as potential biomarkers for CLL: ABCA6, CCDC88A, PMEPA1, EBF1, FILIP1L, and TEAD2 (Zhu et al., 2022) 

### Antibody drug conguate targets: 

- Inotuzumab Ozogamicin (Besponsa): Although initially developed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), inotuzumab ozogamicin may also be considered for some lymphomas. It targets **CD22**, a protein expressed on B-cells, and delivers the cytotoxic payload calicheamicin.
- Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (Mylotarg): While primarily indicated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been used in some cases of **CD33**-positive lymphomas. It delivers the cytotoxic payload calicheamicin.

## Lymphoma

CD20, CD30, BCL2, MYC, CD19

ADC Targets:

- Brentuximab Vedotin (Adcetris): Brentuximab vedotin is an ADC used in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. It targets **CD30**, a protein expressed on the surface of these cancer cells, and delivers the cytotoxic payload monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).
- Polatuzumab Vedotin (Polivy): Polatuzumab vedotin is approved for use in combination with other drugs for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It targets **CD79b, a protein** expressed on the surface of B-cells, and delivers the cytotoxic payload MMAE.
- Loncastuximab Tesirine (Zynlonta): Loncastuximab tesirine is approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. It targets **CD19**, a protein expressed on the surface of B-cells, and delivers the cytotoxic payload SG3199.
