- explore strategies to integrate distinct bioinformatics datasets 
- The population of this study included bioinformatics specialists of a research institution in Lebanon that has strategies to integrate distinct bioinformatics datasets. The data collection process included interviews with 6 bioinformatics specialists and reviewing 27 organizational documents relating to integrating bioinformatics datasets. Thematic analysis was used to identify codes and themes related to integrating distinct bioinformatics datasets. Key themes resulting from data analysis included a focus on integrating bioinformatics datasets, adding metadata with the submitted bioinformatics datasets, centralized bioinformatics database, resources, and bioinformatics tools. 
- specialists who promote standardizing techniques, adding metadata, and centralization may increase efficiency in integrating distinct bioinformatics datasets. 
- The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore the strategies used by bioinformatics specialists to integrate distinct bioinformatics datasets 

- "Lack of collaboration in this area is weak due to limited accessibility and availability in bioinformatics datasets (Machiela & Chanock, 2015). Integrating heterogeneous bioinformatics data is challenging, yet it enables collaboration for bioinformatics specialists to benefit from the increasing biological information and the number of data types. Many challenges affect specialistsâ€™ performance like the poor quality of the generated data, the sample size, false discovery, lack of novel algorithms for data integration, computational efficiency, data interpretation, and visualization (Zhao et al., 2015)."

- Big data, data quality
- Redundancy, heterogeneity, inconsistency, and incompleteness are data quality issues
- data are scattered over a number of repositories using various formats, which makes the process of analyzing data for knowledge extraction challenging. 

- "Biomedical database integration is classified into three main classes: federated, mediated, and warehouse style integration; federated integration, provides hyperlinks to join data; and mediated integration, provides unified query interface as well as collecting the results from various data sources (Ethier et al., 2015). Warehouse databases integrate data sources in one place (Ethier et al., 2015). "

- Text mining for biological publications and sources

- "Many challenges need to be addressed by bioinformaticians for more effectiveness in this field. Bioinformatics specialists experience problems like data quality and processes from different technology platforms, data inconsistencies, incomplete and inaccurate knowledgebases, false discoveries, a lack of novel algorithms for data integration, computational inefficiency, faulty data interpretation, and lack of visualization (Zhao et al., 2015). Other challenges might also be introduced like restrictions from remote servers, security of transmitting biological data over the Internet, and logistics for querying distributed resources (Shah et al., 2005). Understanding the nature of the problems in bioinformatics can be crucial in overcoming them for more efficiency in the bioinformatics research area. "

- Focusing on integrating the data was one of the prominent themes that emerged. The concept was that the submitters of bioinformatics data should unify the format of the data and store them in a centralized location. Homogenizing the data is the biggest problem that most of the interviewees faced. 
- Adding metadata with the submitted bioinformatics datasets was another prominent theme. The central concept of this theme is that leading organizations in the bioinformatics field must ensure that the submitted data has enough metadata. 
- Centralized bioinformatics database
- Resources like The need of high- performance computing to analyze the datasets and decent Internet bandwidth to download and upload large file
