# README

This literature folder contains sources I read to form my knowledge base for this project. In each file, I have copied phrases or paragraphs that were of interest to me directly from each source. This way, I could refer back to see exactly how the authors phrased their findings. I tried to include quotations when I directly copy and pasted significant paragraphs, however many of the bullet points contain direct words from the corresponding research article. 
## Disclaimer: These are not my own words or my own summaries. Each file has the link to the attributed source.
