- Combining data from different expression studies poses a number of statistical difficulties. These diffi- culties arise from the fact that the constituent datasets have often been produced using different gene-expression platforms and different processing facilities. 
- Identifying and removing such systematic effects is the primary statistical challenge in cross-study analysis. Technological differences between studies may be confounded with biological differences arising from the choice of patient cohorts (e.g. age, gender or ethnicity).
