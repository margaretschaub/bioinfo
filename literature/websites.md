# Current challenges and barriers to multi-omics data analysis:
- Missing data: Can be handled with listwise deletion, meaning excluding the entire sample if the data for any variable is missing. This leads to substantial information loss. Another method is imputation, where a regression model replaces missing values with a mean or median of the available variables.

- Dimensionality: Issues arise when gathering a substantially large amount of data from a small sample of patients. Variables are also increased when measurements are taken from multiple platforms. Datasets often need to go through dimensionality reduction either by feature extraction (creating new features from the existing ones) or feature selection (identifying only relevant features).

- No unified public infrastructure for hosting multi-omics data, no consistent standards and protocols

- Heterogeneous data: Datasets have different numbers of variables and mismatched scaling, and are generated using different formats and platforms. Decision trees, regression models, and neural networks are all used to combat this issue, as well as networks like HeteroMed, PARADIGM, or SNF that can handle raw text, numeric, and categorical data in electronic health records (EHRs).

- Scalability: The sheer size and complexity of multi-omics datasets make it impractical to analyze them using traditional machine learning methods on a single computer. Training machine learning models on the entire multi-omics dataset at once may become computationally infeasible or time-consuming. In some studies, training samples may arrive over time, and the dataset might not be available all at once.

# GEO Datasets for Transcriptomics Meta-Analysis in Research
- Transcriptomics databases like GEO, ArrayExpress, Polly, and SRA are used for searching relevant studies

- address missing data, and standardize formats and units 
- challenges such as data heterogeneity, quality assessment, and potential biases that must be carefully addressed to ensure reliable and impactful meta-analysis results.

## Step 1: Data Extraction & Preprocessing
1. Standardization and Normalization Techniques:
- Standardization: To ensure consistency and comparability across studies, researchers standardize gene expression data by mapping gene identifiers to a standard system, such as gene symbols or Entrez IDs, addressing variations in experimental protocols and platforms.
- Normalization: Researchers normalize gene expression data to account for technical variations and differences in library sizes. Standard normalization methods, such as TPM or RPKM normalization, are employed. Count-based data can also be normalized using DESeq or TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values).
2. Dealing with Missing Data and Batch Effects:
- Missing Data: It is common to encounter missing gene expression values within datasets. Various imputation methods, such as mean imputation or k-nearest neighbor imputation, can be employed to estimate missing values based on the available data. Care should be taken to ensure imputation methods do not introduce bias into the analysis.
- Batch Effects: Batch effects, arising from technical variations introduced during data generation, can confound the meta-analysis results. Several techniques, such as ComBat or surrogate variable analysis, can be applied to correct batch effects and reduce their impact on the final meta-analysis.

## Step 2: Statistical Analysis 
1. Selection of Appropriate Statistical Methods:
- Choose statistical methods suitable for the research question and the characteristics of the data. Commonly used methods include fixed-effects models and random-effects models.
- Fixed-effects models assume that the effect sizes are the same across all studies, while random-effects models account for heterogeneity and allow for variation in effect sizes between studies.
2. Combining Effect Sizes and Assessing Heterogeneity:
- Combine effect sizes from individual studies to obtain an overall effect estimate. This can be done using methods such as inverse-variance weighting or weighted averages.
- Assess the heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies using statistical measures such as Cochran's Q test or the I^2 statistic. These measures help quantify the degree of variability between studies and determine if there is significant heterogeneity.
3. Generating Summary Statistics and Visualizations:
- Calculate summary statistics, such as pooled effect sizes, standard errors, and confidence intervals, to summarize the overall meta-analysis results.
- Generate forest plots that visually display each study's effect sizes and confidence intervals, providing a comprehensive view of the combined data.
- Researchers can use additional visualizations like funnel plots or heatmaps to assess publication bias or explore gene expression patterns across studies.

## Step 3: Interpreting Results
1. Biological Interpretation of Meta-Analysis Findings:
- Interpret the meta-analysis results in the context of the research question and the underlying biology. Identify consistent gene expression patterns, differentially expressed genes, enriched pathways, or biological functions that emerge across multiple studies.
- Utilize biological databases, functional annotation tools, and pathway enrichment analysis to gain insights into the biological relevance and potential mechanisms underlying the observed gene expression patterns.
2. Validation through Independent Datasets or Experimental Validation:
- If available, validate the meta-analysis findings by assessing their consistency and reproducibility in independent datasets. This validation helps confirm the robustness and generalizability of the results.
- Alternatively, perform experimental validation through qRT-PCR, western blotting, or functional assays to validate the identified gene expression patterns or molecular signatures. Experimental validation adds a layer of confidence to the meta-analysis findings.
3. Addressing Potential Biases and Limitations:
- Discuss potential biases that may have influenced the meta-analysis results, such as publication bias or selective reporting. Evaluate the impact of these biases on the overall conclusions and consider sensitivity analyses to assess their influence.
- Address limitations associated with the meta-analysis, such as heterogeneity across studies, variations in experimental conditions, data quality issues, or limitations of the included datasets. Provide a balanced interpretation by acknowledging these limitations and their potential impact on the findings.

## Limitations that MA can address 
- Sample size - MA overcomes sample size limitations

- Variability: Biological variability arises from differences in genetic backgrounds, environmental factors, and the inherent stochasticity of molecular processes. Technical variability stems from variations in experimental protocols, data processing methods, and platform-specific biases (e.g., microarray vs. RNA-seq). These sources of variability can lead to inconsistent results across individual studies, making it difficult to discern genuine gene expression patterns from noise. â€”> MA can reduce the impact of individual study-specific noise

# What steps are used to run a differential expression analysis?
The basic process of differential expression analysis can be broken down into several steps:
1. Data collection: The first step in differential expression analysis is to collect the expression data from the samples or conditions being compared. This data is typically in the form of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) or microarray data, but other technologies such as qPCR, single-cell RNA-seq, and proteomic methods can also be used.
2. Data pre-processing: The next step is to pre-process the expression data to remove any artifacts or biases that may be present. This includes steps such as quality control, normalization, and filtering.
3. Statistical analysis: Once the data has been pre-processed, it is then analyzed using statistical methods to identify genes or transcripts that are differentially expressed between the conditions or samples being compared. There are different statistical methods that can be used, such as t-tests, ANOVA, or limma.
4. Multiple test correction: Since many genes or transcripts are analyzed at once, multiple test correction is applied to control the false discovery rate (FDR)
5. Interpretation: The final step is to interpret the results and identify the genes or transcripts that are differentially expressed. This typically involves further analysis, such as functional enrichment analysis, to understand the biological processes or pathways that are affected by the differentially expressed genes or transcripts


- Limma: Limma is a package for linear models. It is a widely used package for differential expression analysis of microarray and RNA-seq data. Limma uses a linear model and moderated t-statistics to estimate the significance of the differential expression of genes or transcripts between conditions or samples. 
- DESeq2: The package for differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution. It uses a negative binomial model to estimate the significance of the differential expression of genes or transcripts between conditions or samples.
