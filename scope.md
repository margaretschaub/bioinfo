# Scope and Objectives

## Scope 
The timeline for the project will be around 5 hours per week for the spring semester from January - May 2024

Scope features that need to be defined:
- Define the specific diseases or conditions of interest for the analysis
- Define which biological feature will be investigated for differential expression (examples are genes, RNA, miRNA, proteins, etc.)

The scope of the project is dynamic and will likely evolve as I delve deeper into specific analyses and encounter new insights. I will regularly reassess the project scope to ensure alignment with my learning goals and available resources.


## Objectives
1. The main objective is to create a deliverable to showcase my bioinformatics knowledge and skills. This deliverable can be used as a reference for other learners and as experience for my future career. 

1. Literature Review and Topic Selection: Conduct a thorough literature review to understand current research trends in bioinformatics, specifically focusing on studies related to differential expression pathways in diverse disease states. Choose a specific disease or diseases of interest for in-depth investigation based on literature findings.

1. Data Exploration and Selection: Explore available open-source datasets related to the chosen disease(s) from reputable repositories. Select and validate datasets that align with the project's focus on differential expression pathways.

1. Comprehensive Bioinformatics Analysis Workflow Implement a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis workflow, leveraging appropriate tools and methodologies based on the chosen diseases, dataset characteristics, and evolving project scope. The workflow will encompass, but is not limited to:

    -Data Preprocessing and Normalization
    -Differential Expression Analysis
    -Statistical Analysis
    -Functional Enrichment Analysis

1. Collaborative Coding and Version Control: Collaborate with others using Git, practicing effective version control and collaborative coding practices. Engage in collaborative coding tasks, such as peer code reviews and joint development efforts.

1. Database Design and Management: Develop and implement a database design that efficiently stores and allows easy access to relevant biological information. Showcase the ability to manage data effectively for both existing information and new entries.

1. Technical Publication and Website Creation. Utilize Quarto as an open-source technical publishing system to create a website showcasing the project.Demonstrate effective communication of project details, methods, and results through the website.
